Weighted baseline
=================

The following example implements a weighted delta committee with a baseline

The "lammps-base" forcefield is meant to be a baseline.  Here it is the short ranged intramolecular (bonds and angles) component of q-TIP4P/f

The "lammps-committee-1" and "lammps-committee-2" forcefields are meant to represent a committee of delta potentials. Here they are the long ranged (electrstatics and LJ) component of q-TIP4P/f calculated at different levels of accuracy 

The systematic error of the baseline model can be set using the "baseline_uncertainty" option, while the error of the committee is calculated from the disagreement between the models
